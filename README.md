## Hi there 👋

I am [Péter Sinkovicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-sinkovicz-phd/), a Principal Software Engineer II with a PhD in theoretical physics. I work on large‑scale machine learning systems, cloud‑native data platforms, and LLM‑based applications.

My academic background includes research on open quantum systems, recurrence phenomena, and strongly correlated many‑body models, with publications in Physical Review A and B. I have broad industry experience, and I specialize in Python, PySpark, ETL pipelines, distributed systems, and cloud technologies such as AWS, Azure, and Databricks. I also have experience building internal tools using React and TypeScript.

My work combines mathematical thinking with practical engineering to create reliable and scalable solutions. I am currently focused on LLM architectures, high‑performance data pipelines, and clean engineering patterns for production systems.

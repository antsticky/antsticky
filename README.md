## Hi there 👋

I am [Péter Sinkovicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-sinkovicz-phd/), a Principal Software Engineer II with a PhD in theoretical physics. I work on large‑scale machine learning systems, cloud‑native data platforms, and LLM‑based applications.

My academic background includes [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jkCQPqwAAAAJ&hl=hu&oi=ao) on open quantum systems, recurrence phenomena, and strongly correlated many‑body models, with publications in Physical Review A and B. I have broad industry experience, and I specialize in Python, PySpark, ETL pipelines, distributed systems, and cloud technologies such as AWS, Azure, and Databricks. I also have experience building internal tools using React and TypeScript.

My work combines mathematical thinking with practical engineering to create reliable and scalable solutions. I am currently focused on LLM architectures, high‑performance data pipelines, and clean engineering patterns for production systems.

## Repositories
# Quantitative Finance Library  
This library implements analytical and numerical pricing methods for markets where the underlying follows a log‑normal diffusion. It compares Black–Scholes formulas with Monte‑Carlo estimators, highlighting where numerical methods diverge or align with exact solutions.

# Minimal Distance Between Two Polylines  
This C++ utility computes whether two polylines come closer than a predefined distance threshold. It provides a fast geometric check using simple vector operations and is useful for collision detection or spatial analysis tasks.

# Quantitative Bridge Library  
This package analyzes bridge games from the Hungarian Championship and similar online commentary systems by comparing a player’s result to both the field performance and the theoretical double‑dummy optimum. It includes core libraries for seating, bidding, and play simulation, as well as analytics tools that interface with online commentators and a built‑in double‑dummy solver.

# Collider Pi  
This repository explores a physics‑inspired system where the number of collisions approximates digits of π. It reproduces the classical “colliding blocks” demonstration and provides a simple simulation to visualize the phenomenon.

# nextjs_vercel  
This project is a learning playground for building and deploying a Next.js  application on Vercel. It demonstrates basic routing, components, and hosting, available publicly at the linked deployment.
